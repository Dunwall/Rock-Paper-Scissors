# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game made with JavaScript, following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course.

## Project Overview

This is a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game that:
- Prompts the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Lets the computer choose a move randomly.
- Plays a total of 5 rounds.
- Displays the winner of each round and the final score.

## What I Learned

- How to use `prompt()` for user input.
- Generating random values with `Math.random()`.
- Writing conditionals (`if/else`) to control game logic.
- Organizing code into functions for reusability.
- Comparing user input with computer choices.
- Keeping track of and displaying scores.

> Note: Currently runs in the **browser console** (open DevTools > Console to play).

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The browser will prompt you to enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
3. The computer will randomly pick its move.
4. You'll see the result of each round.
5. After 5 rounds, the final scores will be shown in an alert.

## To Do Next

- Add buttons to play with clicks instead of `prompt()`.
- Show results on the web page instead of console.
- Add styling and animations for a fun user experience.
